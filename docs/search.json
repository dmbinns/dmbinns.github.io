    "text": "This is Daniela # Visualizing API Data in Python: A Beginner’s Guide\nHave you ever wanted to analyze live data? The way many organizations share their data is through Application Programming Interfaces, more commonly known as APIs. Visualizing API data helps us see trends and patterns in real time, instead of digging through raw text or tables.\nIn this tutorial, we will step into the world of APIs by fetching real data from a public API, turning it into a tidy table with Pandas, and creating a simple chart with Matplotlib.\nMore specifically, we are going to use the Open Notify API to: * Fetch live JSON data about astronauts currently in space. * Convert it into a Pandas DataFrame. * Create a simple visualization of astronauts by spacecraft. This is a short, hands-on exercise you can adapt to almost any API."

To set up, you will need to install and import a few libraries.\nFirst, open your terminal and make sure you have these installed:\nbash pip install requests pandas matplotlib\nIn Python, import the libraries needed for the tutorial. We’ll use requests to call the API, pandas for data wrangling, and matplotlib for plotting.\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np"

You have now accessed a public API, imported it as a Pandas DataFrame, and made a basic chart to visualize it using matplotlib!\nNow you are ready to try accessing public APIs on your own! Test your skills and see if you can visualize API data.\nPick one API from the list below and try to repeat the same workflow: fetch the data, load it into a DataFrame, and build a simple chart. Even a tiny change will give you practice adapting to different data formats: * Pokémon API * Exchange Rates API * COVID-19 API"
